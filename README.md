## Experience

  

### ****Director of AI****

****Onscript AI, East Coast, USA****

__March 2024 - Present (2 months)__

  https://onscript.ai/

-  Onscript AI, a company focused on using artificial intelligence to monitor and improve call center performance.
-   Develop and manage tools that automatically assess agent performance, using AI to highlight both strengths and areas for improvement.
-   Recruited by former colleagues from Digital Media Solutions who recognized my expertise in machine learning and my ability to effectively lead technical teams.
  

### ****Founder and Developer****

****DeepQ****

__November 2021 - Present (2 years 7 months)__

Website:
https://deepq.io
Social media channels:
https://linktr.ee/deepqtv  

- Founded a startup that pushes the boundaries of deepfake detection and voice cloning technology.
- DeepFake detection algorithms that can recognize artefacts due to bias of GAN models (Vocoder in audio, others in image/video) models. 

-  Successfully launched a mobile application that allows users to speak in over 100 celebrity voices, showcasing advanced capabilities in voice to voice cloning using models like VITS and HuBERT.

### ****Research and Development Engineer (Machine Learning)****

****Digital Media Solutions****

__July 2021 - August 2023 (2 years 2 months)__

- Quality control of the agents using ASR, LLM and spectrogram analysis
- autopilot system for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech in multiple dialects and accents. Similar project to what I've been doing in Yodel Technologies

  

### ****Machine Learning Engineer****

****Yodel Technologies****

__December 2018 - July 2021 (2 years 8 months)__

  

- automated machine and robokiller detection in real time using spectrograms and MFCC and other representations

- Autopilot which would replace real agent using ASR, TTS and Rasa (back in the days), project failed due to regulations but it lasted 2 years. Voice at the time was built as TTS using arhitectures like Tacotron, tacotron2, fastpitch, etc.
  

### ****Elixir Developer****

****Yodel Technologies****

__August 2018 - December 2018 (5 months)__

  

- Focused on back-end development, enhancing application performance and working with OTP, and doing lots of audio data.

## Projects

  

***SongQ Celebrity voice changer***
https://linktr.ee/songq

Developed a cross-platform application that supports real-time voice cloning and pitch modification, it has 100 voices and models are running on edge device (F0 detector, hubert encoder, multi-speaker decoders, bandwidth expanders...)

****Virtual Avatars in eLearning****

Partnering with the University of Zagreb to create virtual avatars that use AI to enhance the learning experience.

University in Zagreb called me to work on their scientific studies on virtual avatars in elearning and there is a possibility I will start doctorate studies on voice reconstruction (there is a case study of recovering voice of Nikola Tesla from old audio files) where we have these files in Qdrant vector database and we also have lots of other similar voices and we are going to sample the closest matches to fix the holes and expand the frequency bandwidth in the old audio files.
